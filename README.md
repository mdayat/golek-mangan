## What

**Golek Mangan** is an application that curates the best restaurants in Indonesia. The process of selecting, assessing, and including a restaurant in the list of the best restaurants is carried out by our expert teams so that it can be ensured that it meets the standards.

## Tech Stack

For development purposes, I chose [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) over JavaScript as the main language because it can save my life from "unwanted" errors. As for the bundler, I chose [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) because it is one of the requirements of this project. To keep me in check and follow the best practices, I decided to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) along with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html).
